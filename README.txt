Dear User,

app.py is an application program to interact with a sqlite database. To use the application program, run 
./app.py and then, in your browser (preferably using chrome), go to http://localhost:8080

The database, proj.db, should be in the same directory as app.py. the folder, web, should also be in the same directory as proj.db. 

for mass loading of CSV files: I have assumed that the CSV files will have the column names as the first line of the file. Therefore, the first line of each csv file will be ignored.
