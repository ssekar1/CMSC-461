Testing Log:

11/22/15
	11:49 - Observed issue with SELECT * on Teaches table, corrected with if-statement to check type of 'temp'

11/23/15
	12:10 - When loading a good CSV and a bad CSV, the good CSV is accepted instead of being rejected along with the bad CSV.
			Attempted to fix issue by modifying bulk_load method on app_lib.py, but was unable to limit data commit until after
			CSV verification
