heres what some of the files do:
sqlite3 project.db < drop_script deletes the tables
sqlie3 project.db < make_tables makes the tables
sqlite3 project.db < drop_tables > drop_script makes drop_script

for loading csv files, separate the items by commas. do not use spaces between comma separated items
no newline at end of csv file

functions in test.py:

#returns list of primary keys for table
def get_pk(table):

#returns 1 for good, 0 for bad
#it is bad if there is a course id in course which is not in teaches
def check_teaches():

#returns 1 for good, 0 for bad
#it is bad if there is a course id in course which is not in has
def check_has():

#you had better check that the list, values, has the same number of columns as table does
def insert(values, table):

#values is a list
#the table had better have a primary key
#better verify that the values aren't sql injections
def delete(values, table):

#assumes all parameters are not lists
def update(table, column, value, zk):

#takes a table and a csv file. puts data in
def bulk_load(table, csv_file):
