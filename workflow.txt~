workflow:

the user will need the following to insert into course:
	course_id, course_name, credit_hours, instructor_id, isbn

	before performing an insert into course, will have to create a textbook for the course:
		isbn, title, author, cost
	and an instructor for the course:
		instructor_id, instructor_name, salary

	before doing the insert for course:
	1) turn off autocommit
	2) do the insert
	3) run check_has() and check_teaches()
	4) if either one returns 0, rollback. else commit
	5) turn on autocommit again
